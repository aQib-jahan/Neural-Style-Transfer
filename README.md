# **Neural Style Transfer**
The project generates a new image with the targeted content and style. The model takes 2 images as input. Within these 2 images, one image is used for style transfer and another is used for content transfer.
The model extracts the style from the targeted image and merge that with the image which is to be converted.

## **The input-output images:**
<img src="final.jpg" align="center" width="200" height="200">

## **Libraries used:**
* PyTorch
* Matplotlib
* Pillow
* Numpy
